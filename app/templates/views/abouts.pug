			p.
				In this project, we are required to find a reference book (The Book of Numbers), choose several interesting sections (9, 11, 30, 365.25) to form our project, and then show to our classmates the information and the things we could learn from them.
				<br />Please see our website and you will see the very wonderful maths knowledge which we have chosen for you.
				<br />Enjoy!
